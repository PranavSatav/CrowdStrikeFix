### Automated Workaround in Safe Mode using Group Policy

You can set up a GPO to run a script during Safe Mode. Hereâ€™s how you can do this:

1. **Create the PowerShell Script**
    
    Create a PowerShell script that deletes the problematic CrowdStrike driver file causing BSODs and handles the Safe Mode boot and revert:
    
    ```powershell
    
    # CrowdStrikeFix.ps1
    # This script deletes the problematic CrowdStrike driver file causing BSODs and reverts Safe Mode
    
    $filePath = "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\C-00000291*.sys"
    $files = Get-ChildItem -Path $filePath -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    
    foreach ($file in $files) {
        try {
            Remove-Item -Path $file.FullName -Force
            Write-Output "Deleted: $($file.FullName)"
        } catch {
            Write-Output "Failed to delete: $($file.FullName)"
        }
    }
    
    # Revert Safe Mode Boot after Fix
    bcdedit /deletevalue {current} safeboot
    
    ```
    
2. **Create a GPO for Safe Mode**
    - Open the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC).
    - Right-click on the appropriate Organizational Unit (OU) and select `Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here...`.
    - Name the GPO, for example, `CrowdStrike Fix Safe Mode`.
3. **Edit the GPO**
    - Right-click the new GPO and select `Edit`.
    - Navigate to `Computer Configuration -> Policies -> Windows Settings -> Scripts (Startup/Shutdown)`.
    - Double-click `Startup`, then click `Add`.
    - In the `Script Name` field, browse to the location where you saved `CrowdStrikeFix.ps1` and select it.
    - Click `OK` to close all dialog boxes.
4. **Force Safe Mode Boot Using a Script**
    
    Create another PowerShell script to force Safe Mode boot and link it to a GPO for immediate application:
    
    ```powershell
    
    # ForceSafeMode.ps1
    # This script forces the computer to boot into Safe Mode
    
    bcdedit /set {current} safeboot minimal
    Restart-Computer
    
    ```
    
5. **Create a GPO to Apply the Safe Mode Script**
    - Open the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC).
    - Right-click on the appropriate Organizational Unit (OU) and select `Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here...`.
    - Name the GPO, for example, `Force Safe Mode`.
    - Right-click the new GPO and select `Edit`.
    - Navigate to `Computer Configuration -> Policies -> Windows Settings -> Scripts (Startup/Shutdown)`.
    - Double-click `Startup`, then click `Add`.
    - In the `Script Name` field, browse to the location where you saved `ForceSafeMode.ps1` and select it.
    - Click `OK` to close all dialog boxes.
6. **Apply the GPOs**
    - Make sure the `Force Safe Mode` GPO is applied to the affected computers first.
    - The computer will boot into Safe Mode and execute the `CrowdStrikeFix.ps1` script.
    - Once the issue is fixed, the script will revert the boot settings to normal mode.
